# Project Index: Save Soul of Zlaya Babka (SSZB)

Generated: 2026-02-23 (updated: refactor snake_case to CamelCase, add input.h, clang-tidy/CMake cleanup)

## Overview

Rewriting a Scala/libgdx pixel-art game "Save Soul of Zlaya Babka" into C/Raylib. The game is about an angry grandma ("Zlaya Babka") who defends her apartment building from rowdy youngsters.

**Do NOT compile the Scala legacy code. Only compile the C Raylib application.**

## Entry Points

- **C Application**: `src/main.c` — Raylib game loop with TCP command server on port 9999
- **Native build**: `make build` then `make run`
- **Run tests**: `make test` (builds, launches game, runs `.sszb` test script, reports results)
- **Web build**: `make build_web` then `make run_web` (opens http://localhost:3000/Game.html)

## C Raylib Application (Current State)

Game engine foundation with types, assets, core logic, night phase, and day phase fully implemented.

### src/input.h (6 lines)
- Declares `ManagedIsKeyPressed(int key)` and `ManagedIsMouseButtonPressed(int button)`
- Managed input functions combining physical Raylib input + TCP-injected input
- Defined in `main.c`, included by `night.c` and `day.c`
- Previously these were extern-declared inline in night.c and day.c

### src/main.c (~402 lines)
- Window: 1366x768 ("Save Soul of Zlaya Babka"), 60 FPS
- `srand(time(NULL))` called after InitWindow for random number seeding
- TCP command server on port 9999 (disabled in WASM builds)
- `ManagedIsKeyPressed` / `ManagedIsMouseButtonPressed` — defined here, declared in `input.h`; pure raylib input on web
- Full 9-state game state machine: LOGO -> MENU -> TUTOR1/2/3 -> NIGHT <-> DAY -> WIN/OVER
- State transition handlers: enter/exit callbacks for NIGHT and DAY phases; STATE_OVER enter handler is intentionally empty (reset happens on ENTER press)
- `Update()` — extracted frame function for emscripten_set_main_loop compatibility
- `StateUpdate` / `StateRender` — per-state logic and rendering dispatching
- `HandleCommand` / `HandleAssertField` — TCP command dispatch, extracted from Update for cognitive complexity
- `#ifdef PLATFORM_WEB` guards for emscripten/WASM builds
- Audio device initialization before asset loading
- Proper cleanup sequence: assets, command server, audio device, window
- Script test support: `GameGetFieldInt()` for querying game state, `StateName()` for enum→string, ASSERT/GET/WAIT_STATE handling
- **No network code** — all socket operations delegated to command_server.h

### src/command_server.h (~516 lines)
- STB-style header-only library (`#define COMMAND_SERVER_IMPLEMENTATION`)
- Non-blocking TCP server on localhost — all network code centralized here
- All functions use CamelCase: `CommandServerInit`, `CommandServerPoll`, `CommandServerRespond`, `CommandServerCleanup`
- Extracted `CommandServerReadClient` helper to reduce cognitive complexity of `CommandServerPoll`
- Single-command mode: `SCREENSHOT <file>`, `KEY_PRESS <code>`, `MOUSE_PRESS <button>`, `MOVE_MOUSE <x> <y>`, `QUIT`
- Script runner mode: `SCRIPT <file>` loads `.sszb` test script, executes line-per-frame
- ScriptRunner struct: line buffer, WAIT counter, WAIT_STATE target, pass/fail counters, report buffer
- Script runner API: `ScriptRunnerLoad`, `ScriptRunnerTick`, `ScriptRunnerFinish`, `ScriptRunnerReport`, `ScriptRunnerRespond`
- Script commands: KEY, MOUSE, MOVE, SHOT, WAIT, WAIT_STATE, ASSERT_STATE, ASSERT_EQ/GE/LE, GET, LOG, QUIT
- `ScriptRunnerRespond()` — variadic TCP response for GET queries (moved from main.c)
- Persistent TCP connection during script execution; sends report on completion
- Added braces to all single-statement if/return bodies; fixed `bugprone-misplaced-widening-cast`

### src/game_types.h (225 lines)
- All game constants (screen, building grid, entity limits, timing, prices, physics thresholds)
- Coordinate conversion macros: `FLIP_Y(y,h)`, `ROOM_GDX_X(col)`, `ROOM_GDX_Y(row)`
- Enums: GameState, RoomType, CreatureType, WeightType, AnimType
- Structs: Room, Creature, Weight (with hit_l0/hit_l1 one-shot collision flags), Bullet, AnimEffect, CashSprite, SpriteAnim, GameAssets, Game
- Removed unused `#include <stdlib.h>`
- CamelCase function declarations: `SpriteAnimFrame`, `SpriteAnimDuration`, `SpriteAnimSetup`, `RoomCooldownTime`, `RoomRepairPrice`, `RoomBuyPrice`, `RoomWeaponPrice`, `RoomGratePrice`, `DifficultyHooliganSpeed`, `DifficultyHooliganCooldown`, `DifficultyWhoreSpeed`, `DifficultyWhoreCooldown`, `DifficultyGeneratorTimer`, `DifficultySpawnRandom`, `GameInitHouse`, `GameReset`

### src/game.c (~276 lines)
- All functions use CamelCase naming convention
- `SpriteAnimFrame` / `SpriteAnimDuration` / `SpriteAnimSetup` — sprite sheet animation helpers
- `RoomCooldownTime` / `RoomRepairPrice` / `RoomBuyPrice` / `RoomWeaponPrice` / `RoomGratePrice` — room economics
- `DifficultyHooliganSpeed` / `DifficultyHooliganCooldown` / `DifficultyWhoreSpeed` / `DifficultyWhoreCooldown` / `DifficultyGeneratorTimer` / `DifficultySpawnRandom` — per-level enemy speed, cooldowns, spawn patterns
- `GameInitHouse` — 3x6 room layout from legacy Scala RenderFactory
- `GameReset` — full game state reset

### src/assets.h / assets.c (4 + 171 lines)
- `AssetsLoad` — loads all textures, sprite sheets, animations, fonts, music, SFX
- `AssetsUnload` — cleans up all loaded resources
- 51 textures, 9 sprite animations, 1 font, 3 music streams, 8 sound effects

### src/day.h / day.c (~318 lines)
- **DayEnter**: play round_end sound, start birds music, reset frame animation
- **DayUpdate**: shopping phase input handling:
  - Arrow keys: navigate rooms (day selection rule: room bought OR adjacent to bought)
  - KEY_ONE: buy room or repair broken room
  - KEY_TWO: install grate (if room bought, not broken, no grate)
  - KEY_THREE: install weapon (if room bought, not broken, not armed)
  - KEY_FOUR: buy club (win condition, costs 400)
  - ENTER: advance to next night round
  - Music stream update for birds BGM
  - State transitions: ENTER → NIGHT, club_bought → WIN
- **DayRender**: 6-layer render pipeline:
  1. Background (bg_day)  2. Club building (club_day)
  3. Room loop: in-window weapons, lights (light_on/light_day), window frames (day variants)
  4. Money display  5. Animated selection frame  6. Shop UI (buy/repair, grate, weapon, club buttons with green/red price text)
- **DayExit**: stop birds music, increment level
- Helper functions: `HandleNavigation`, `HandleShopInput`, `HandleBuyOrRepair`, `RenderRoom`, `RenderShopUI`, `DrawPriceLabel`

### src/night.h / night.c (~910 lines)
- Functions use CamelCase naming (NightEnter, NightUpdate, NightRender, NightExit)
- Logic decomposed into ~20 static helper functions to keep cognitive complexity low
- **NightEnter**: reset hits/timers/entities, start crickets music
- **NightUpdate**: orchestrates subsystem updates:
  - UpdateInputHandling — arrow keys, SPACE fire, cheats L/P/ESC
  - UpdateFireWeapon — spawn falling weights from armed rooms
  - SpawnCreatures — AI spawning with difficulty-scaled timers
  - UpdateCreatures / UpdateCreatureAttack — creature AI (hooligan shoots bullets, whore does selfie)
  - UpdateBullets — atan2 homing, grate/window damage
  - UpdateWeights / CheckWeightCollision* / WeightHitGround — falling, AABB collision on two lanes, kill/reward
  - UpdateRoomCooldowns, UpdateLooseControl, UpdateSelfieFlash, UpdateAnimations
  - State transitions: night won -> DAY, 5 hits -> OVER
- **NightRender**: delegates to 13 render helpers for 15-layer pipeline:
  RenderClubBuilding, RenderBabkaInWindow, RenderInWindowWeapons, RenderLights,
  RenderWindowFrames, RenderBabkaHandsUp, RenderCashSprites, RenderCreatures,
  RenderDeathAnimations, RenderFallingWeights, RenderBullets, RenderFrameSelector,
  RenderHud, RenderSelfieFlash
- **NightExit**: stop music, clear all entities

## Game Design (from Legacy Scala Code)

### Game Flow
```
Logo → Menu → Tutorial(1-3) → [Night → Day]* → GameWin/GameOver → restart
```

### Night Phase (defend, 30 seconds per level)
- Babka sits in window of apartment building (3x6 grid of rooms)
- Enemies approach: Hooligans (throw bottles, break windows) and Whores (take selfies, blind babka)
- Babka drops items from windows: Pot (flower), TV, Royal Piano
- Arrow keys to move between rooms, Space to attack
- Club nearby plays loud music — damages babka
- Lose condition: 5 hits

### Day Phase (shop/upgrade)
- Arrow keys to select room in building grid
- `1` — Buy or repair room
- `2` — Buy armor (grate) for room
- `3` — Weaponize room (assign drop item)
- `4` — Buy club (win condition, costs 400)
- Win condition: buy the club

### Key Constants
- Screen: 1366x768 (legacy), 1366x768 (current C prototype)
- Building: 3 rows x 6 columns of rooms
- Room types: PotRoom, TVRoom, RoyalRoom (different weapons/costs)
- Start money: 10, Club price: 400
- Level time: 30 seconds

## Build Configuration

- **CMake**: C23 standard (no C++ standard set), vendored raylib, strict warnings (`-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic`)
- **Native**: macOS (Apple frameworks: IOKit, Cocoa, OpenGL), ASan/UBSan enabled (conditional on `NOT EMSCRIPTEN`)
- **Web/WASM**: Emscripten with `--embed-file assets/`, ASYNCIFY, GLFW3; sanitizers disabled
- **Dependency**: raylib vendored as git submodule in `vendor/raylib/`
- **clang-tidy**: CMake target with macOS sysroot auto-detection; config in `.clang-tidy` (CamelCase functions, `HeaderFilterRegex: "src/.*"`, bugprone/google/misc/modernize/performance/readability checks; disabled: `modernize-macro-to-enum`, `readability-identifier-length`, `misc-no-recursion`)
- **clang-format**: Google style, 120 columns; config in `.clang-format`

## Quick Start

4. Open http://localhost:3000/Game.html in browser

## Game Design Document

**[docs/GAME_DESIGN.md](docs/GAME_DESIGN.md)** — Complete game design document (in Russian) covering all gameplay features: night/day phases, difficulty system, economy, room layout, weapons, enemies, win/lose conditions, and cheat codes.

## Architecture Document

**[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** — Complete C/Raylib architecture blueprint:
- All source files (.h/.c) with module responsibilities
- Every struct definition (Room, Creature, Bullet, Weight, CrashAnim, CashPickup, SpriteSheet, Assets, Game)
- State machine (LOGO→MENU→TUTORIAL→NIGHT→DAY→GAMEOVER/WIN)
- Function signatures for night.c, day.c, assets.c, game.c
- Raylib coordinate system conversions from libgdx (Y-up → Y-down)
- Animation frame sequences for all sprite sheets
- Entity management pattern (fixed arrays + alive flag + compact)
- 6 implementation milestones in dependency order

## What Has Been Ported

1. **Game types & constants** — all structs, enums, macros (game_types.h)
2. **Core game logic** — sprite animation, room economics, difficulty scaling, house layout (game.c)
3. **Asset pipeline** — full load/unload of all textures, animations, fonts, audio (assets.c)
4. **Night phase** — complete tower defense gameplay: AI, spawning, combat, rendering, audio (night.c)
5. **Day phase** — room shopping/upgrade: navigation, buy/repair/grate/weapon/club, shop UI rendering (day.c)

## Balance Verification

All game balance parameters have been audited against the original Scala code. Key fixes applied:
- Spawn probability: ~50% of spawns now correctly produce dual-lane enemies (matching Scala's signed-int RNG behavior)
- Selfie flash: 0.5s delay before activation (matching Scala's deferred callback)
- Creature movement: enemies keep walking during attack animations (matching Scala's unconditional movement)
- BGM Cool: pause/resume instead of stop/restart (preserving playback position)
- Club purchase: C correctly subtracts money (`-= CLUB_PRICE`), fixing an original Scala bug (`= CLUB_PRICE`)

## Automated Testing

Frame-based test scripting system using `.sszb` files. See `docs/TEST_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` for full design.

- `SCRIPT <file>` TCP command loads a script and executes it line-per-frame inside the game loop
- Commands: `KEY`, `MOUSE`, `MOVE`, `SHOT`, `WAIT <frames>`, `WAIT_STATE <state> [timeout]`
- Assertions: `ASSERT_STATE`, `ASSERT_EQ/GE/LE <field> <value>`, `GET <field>`
- Reports: pass/fail counts + per-line details sent via TCP on completion
- Run: `make test` or `./tests/run_test.sh [script.sszb]`

## Status

All major systems have been ported. The game is fully playable with complete state machine integration. Both native (macOS) and web (WASM) builds are functional. Automated frame-based testing is operational.
